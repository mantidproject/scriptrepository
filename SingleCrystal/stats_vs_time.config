# Configuration file for stats_vs_time.py.
#
# This script will integrate predicted peaks with varying counting times.
# It will then analyze the data for the number of peaks above 2 sig, etc.
# It will plot the results and save the results in a saved plot file
# and in a stats_vs_time.lst file.
#
# Before running this script, an integrate and UB Niggli matrix file must
# be created. The files "run_Niggli.integrate" and "run_Niggli.mat", where
# run is the run number, must exist in the working directory.
#
# Each line can either start with a comment, indicated by a '#' mark or start
# with a parameter name and value, optionally followed by a comment.  ALL 
# parameters used by the script must be specified.  If a required parameter 
# is not specified, the script will terminate with a message indicating which 
# parameter was missing.
